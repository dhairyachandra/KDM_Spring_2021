The frigid temperatures, snow and ice that have devastated parts of the country are having an impact on Covid-19 vaccinations, delaying deliveries and appointments for shots.

"I don't believe that it's anticipated it will have long-reaching outcomes, but certainly for the next week to two weeks, we might expect to see some impact from the weather," Lori Tremmel Freeman, CEO of the National Association of County and City Health Officials, told CNN on Wednesday.

"The two biggest shippers involved here -- UPS and FedEx -- have major either hubs or warehouses down in the South, in Memphis and in other areas. So, we do expect there could be a blip in delivery of vaccine that is weather related specifically," Freeman added.

Jeff Zients, the White House Covid-19 response coordinator, said Wednesday the federal government was encouraging governors and other partners to extend hours once vaccine sites are able to reopen.

Lenovo kicked off its smart-home journey by launching the Lenovo Smart Clock and Smart Display in 2019. Last year, the company launched the Smart Clock Essential with built-in Google Assistant support to extend the product lineup. Now, Lenovo has launched the device in India to gain an upper-hand in the booming IoT market in the country.

Lenovo Smart Clock Essential: Key Specs


 
Before moving to the price and availability of Lenovo Smart Clock Essential in India, let me give you an overview of the key specs of the device.

The Smart Clock Essential is a smart speaker with a display. It features a 4-inch LED panel which, unfortunately, does not support touch input. It can show you the current time, temperature, days of the week, and notifications for scheduled alarms.

The device supports Google Assistant, as I mentioned before. So, you can also use the Smart Clock Essential like a smart speaker and ask the voice assistant to play music or fetch the current news. The device will play the media on its 3W 1.5″ speaker.

Moreover, it is the company’s first smart home device to come with built-in support for Hindi language commands.
